# `meson` (`hadron` variant)

This is a fork of `meson` project with a focus on the `cmake` module to be used as the base for a new build system for C++ libraries for JavaScript - both WASM and Node.js

It includes:
 * Support for `conan` `CMake` config files
 * Support for `$CONFIG` generator expressions
 * Support for `install_data(FILES ...)`
 * Several bugfixes related target dependencies

 # Why fork `meson`

In fact, most of my projects are forks - I am currently in the middle of a huge judicial scandal, you can find more details on my main profile page, which involves corrupt criminal judges, the French police and some shocking sexual elements - which is the reason for the whole affair - at my previous employers. Currently, I am being extorted to accept to stop talking about this affair, by all the projects in which I have been working.

As I prefer to avoid dealing with criminal elements when working, I simply fork these projects.

Should at any moment, any of those projects decide that they do not have any conditions linked to this affair, I will be willing to merge back those changes.
